# Practical Network State

## My Tweet Text

Where is the best place to be over the next 15 years?

### Our Family

- American dad
- Cambodian mom
- 5 year old boy
- 1 year old boy
- We want to have more kids

### Desired Characteristics

- Great education, public or private is okay, but must be great
- Growing economy, not a "declining world"
- Really fast internet widely available 
- Nice if foreigners can own land/houses directly
- Crypto community
- Cost of getting set up should be less than $164k (this is the cost of the Thai elite visa for ten years times four people)
- We should be able to stay there indefinitely once set up 
- Friendly people 
- Private education should not cost crazy Harvard prices for elementary and high school (example of crazy: 40k USD a year in Hanoi)
- Affordable real estate 

### Type of Advice Sought

- Shill me xyz area
- How to hit the ground running 
- Schools
- Neighborhoods
- Intros

### Places That Are Ruled Out

- United States (healthcare costs and crypto climate make this senseless, and if we did go there we would go to Buffalo, NY)
- Vietnam (bad vibes man)
- Cambodia (I stole a giant truck full of sand there when having a bipolar episode and I can't go there, but I would, if I could, since Sopheavy is from there)
- Places where it is prohibitively difficult for our family to stop through to get a feel for life there. Cambodian passports aren't very strong 

Thank you very much for any advice. We hope to begin dating locations 30 days hence.
